# QuizMaker
A bare bones Ruby on Rails app for creating online quizzes 

## Background:
 - This is a super simple, bare-bones Ruby on Rails app that lets a user create a quiz for others to take.
 - I created it as a skills development exercise, building an app entirely on my own once I finished apps developed as parts of guided coursework.
 - It is a work in progress, but the first phase (admin/teacher back end and interface) is functional, with improvements to come.
 - It is intended to remain in a development environment for the time being.

## Improvements/Additions to Come:
 - [ ] Creation & Integration of a "student" view, for those taking a test
 - [ ] Additional security enhancements
 - [ ] Front End design updates
 - [ ] Test suite creation
